# MSH Minishell - A Basic Unix Shell written in C
## Introduction
MSH is a basic Unix Shell that provides a simple READ PARSE EVAL loop to execute
binaries available in the system's PATH variable. 
It is a project at Ecole 42 (Paris | Silicon Valley) and builds the foundation
for a full blown shell (42 Shell) that remains to be built in consecutive
projects.
